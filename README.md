Pokemon Card Collector Version 2 is a card collecting and tragedy game. Currently in the makes to feature collecting cards in a binder, buying packs, and more.

Pokemon Card Collector V1 was created in order to exhibit and retrain my programming skills right after taking Object Orienting at Florida State University in 2021. It served as a review for concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and building/using a custom dynamic array (vector). Some problems with V1:

I was a rookie and had not transitioned into my "academic prime". Code was nonoptimal, especially for packs/loot code.
Lacked a graphical user interface (it was a text game).
Depedent on FSU's linux server to program. The server only allocated about 1.5 GB of space per user. Space restriction hindered code development.
Pokemon Card Collector V2 is an updated version. Like its ancestor, its aim is to exhibit and retrain my programming skills. In addition, now that I have Data Structures, Algorithims, and Operating Systems (much expereince in C), I am a much stronger programmer that still desires to refresh my knowledge. To refresh my knowledge and skills, I am hope to implement the following in version 2:

Set up a C++ complier on my computer to get away from relying on a Linux server just for GNU.
Use SDL as a video game frame work.
Use an AVL tree as my data strucutre for the master list of cards.
The rest of my objectives are secondary targets that I am wishing to hit. These are more so game design/concepts rather than technical reviews:

A game design around the cards so that they can be used to win/lose.
A computer bot that has some logic in order to defeat the player when challenged.
A market to sell/buy cards.
A slot machine to wager and gain new cards.
